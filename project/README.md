# YOUR PROJECT TITLE
#### Video Demo:  <[URL HERE](https://youtu.be/8mtUGYbtqRE)>
#### Description:is a project that aims to make people proactive, where they are warned from time to time (they choose) and can be from 1 minute to more than 1 hour. I thought about this even for myself, because I feel like I'm becoming less and less productive, so I thought this would help me become more productive and could help other people be too.In particular. I believe that this is a problem for an entire generation, in which they live connected to the internet and have become accustomed to practicality, without worrying about the effort and time to be spent. That's why I think it would be a good way to at least attract thoughts to this cause, and try to make some of these people aware that they need to change along with me to achieve their goals. By integrating timely reminders into our daily routines, we can cultivate healthier work habits and foster greater awareness of our time management. This project is not just about taking breaks; it’s about promoting a balanced lifestyle where productivity and well-being coexist harmoniously. Ultimately, our goal is to assist users in becoming more mindful of their time and more intentional in their actions, leading to enhanced productivity and a more fulfilling digital experience. I believe that by implementing a system that warns users about the importance of taking periodic breaks, we can improve mental and physical health, as well as increase efficiency at work and studies. Oftentimes, we get so immersed in our tasks that we forget to take care of ourselves. With this extension, I hope to help people find a healthy balance between work and rest, promoting a more mindful approach to productivity. I would like to express my gratitude to the CS50 course, which provided me with the skills and knowledge necessary to develop this project. Through the classes and challenges, I learned not only to program, but also to think critically about how technology can be used to improve people's lives. The support of the CS50 community and the resources available were instrumental in turning this idea into a reality. I hope this extension can benefit many users and contribute to a more productive and balanced lifestyle.
