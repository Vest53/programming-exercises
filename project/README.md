# YOUR PROJECT TITLE
#### Video Demo:  <[URL HERE](https://youtu.be/8mtUGYbtqRE)>
#### Description:is a project that aims to make people proactive, where they are warned from time to time (they choose) and can be from 1 minute to more than 1 hour. I thought about this even for myself, because I feel like I'm becoming less and less productive, so I thought this would help me become more productive and could help other people be too.In particular. I believe that this is a problem for an entire generation, in which they live connected to the internet and have become accustomed to practicality, without worrying about the effort and time to be spent. That's why I think it would be a good way to at least attract thoughts to this cause, and try to make some of these people aware that they need to change along with me to achieve their goals. By integrating timely reminders into our daily routines, we can cultivate healthier work habits and foster greater awareness of our time management. This project is not just about taking breaks; it’s about promoting a balanced lifestyle where productivity and well-being coexist harmoniously. Ultimately, our goal is to assist users in becoming more mindful of their time and more intentional in their actions, leading to enhanced productivity and a more fulfilling digital experience.
